/**
 * FUNCTIONS
 * 0: 
 * 1: The two phases of using functions: First we must _? Next we can execute (or two other words for executing a function?) a function by?
 * 2: What's teh difference between a functions parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?
 * 3: What's the syntax for a NAMED function?
 * 4: How do we assign a function to a variable?
 * 5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we specififuy inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
 * 6: Scope: functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true
 * 7: Closures: Functions form closures around teh data they house. IF an object returned from teh FUnction and is held in memeory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIE, and data can continue to exist in these colosures!
