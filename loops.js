/**
 * LOOPS
 * 0: Loops are used to repeat code a set amount of times. They iterate over a piece of data and access the values within individually. Usually loops are used for the indexes of arrays and the properties on an object. Looping can also access the individual characters in strings and numbers with 2 or more digits. Loops are an essential building blocks of source code, and their variants can be broad or specifically structured for one type of data.
 * 
 * The three main components of a loop are the 
    * Statement, 
    * Expression(s), and 
    * Code Block.
*
* These concepts are best elucidated by going over presenting them in context....
 * 
 * 1: For, While, and For-in Loops
 * 
 * For loops are the most straight forward because it's syntax mirrors the foundational structure of a loop. They are also the most 'generic' of the loops, in that they can be used on the most datatypes. 
 * 
 * Array for loops follow this basic structure:
    * for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        *  code block to be repeated
    * }
 *  
 * where...
    * for: statement
    *  var i = 0 : expression 1
    *  i < array.length: expression 2
    *  i ++ : expression 3
    * {} : code block
 *  
 *        
 * 
 * 
 * 2: Be able to loop any number of times, forward counting up to some limit, backward counting down to 0
 * 3: Loop over an Array, forwards and backwards
 * 4: Loop over an Object
